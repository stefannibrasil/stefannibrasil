## Hello, I’m Stefanni Brasil.

*Brasil* is my real name, how cool is that?! :)

I am the co-founder of [@hexdevs](https://github.com/hexdevs), where we help you become an expert Ruby developer through our training programs and courses. I’m the co-creator of [Get to Senior](https://academy.hexdevs.com/), an online program to help experienced Ruby developers make the jump to Senior level.

I am a self-taught developer, avid reader, and cats lover. I write on [my blog](https://www.stefannibrasil.me/), host live Open Source Thursdays coding sessions and co-host the [hexdevs podcast](https://podcast.hexdevs.com/).

I’ve been giving talks at local meetups, RubyConf Sao Paulo, RailsConf. In 2021, I delivered a talk at RubyConf on [“Perceptual Learning == More Ruby Experts?”](https://www.hexdevs.com/rubyconf2021/). For Speaking inquiries, please see my [Speaking page](https://www.stefannibrasil.me/speaking/).

I am a huge believer that everyone is capable of achieving whatever they want for their lives. I'm driven by curiosity and kindness.

Welcome! 👋
