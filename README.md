## Hello, Iâ€™m Stefanni Brasil.

*Brasil* is my real name, how cool is that?! :)

I am the co-founder of [hexdevs](https://www.hexdevs.com/), where I build programs that train developers for excellence. I am a self-taught developer, avid reader, and cats lover. I write here on my blog, host live Open Source Thursdays coding sessions, and co-host the hexdevs podcast.

Besides that, I've been giving lightning talks at local meetups and giving talks at technical conferences.

I am a huge believer that everyone is capable of achieving whatever they want for their lives. I'm driven by curiosity and kindness.

Check out [my blog](https://www.stefannibrasil.me/about/) to learn more about me.

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
